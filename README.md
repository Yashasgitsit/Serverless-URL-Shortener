# Serverless-URL-Shortener
Built a serverless web application that allows users to shorten long URLs and access shortened links 
for redirection. 
• Designed and hosted a static frontend on AWS S3 and developed backend logic using AWS Lambda 
integrated via API Gateway. 
• Implemented DynamoDB to store and retrieve URL mappings, ensuring low-latency operations. 
• Created a unique short code generator and redirect mechanism with custom domain routing through 
API Gateway.
